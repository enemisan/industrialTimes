                <section class="post-ctn">
                    <p class="post">The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning, to collaborate to develop and implement non-contradictory and well-synthesized monetary and fiscal policy that support domestic manufacturing and the productive sectors in general.<br />
<br />
Segun Ajayi-Kadir, the Director-General of MAN, said that such collaboration will do good to the economy, bearing in mind that the Nigerian economy remains fragile and bedeviled with numerous challenges that inhibit growth.<br />
<br />
Ajayi-Kadir was reacting to the CBN&#039;s Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) which raised to 18.5 percent in May 2023 from 18 percent<br />
<br />
He said that the MPR increase is the 7th in a trend and the inflation rate continues to rise despite the increases.<br />
<br />
&quot; It is evident that the continuous and consistent increase in MPR is not yielding the desired growth in the economy.<br />
<br />
The increase in MPR from 18% to 18.5% will certainly lead to an increase in lending rates and worsen the uncompetitiveness of the manufacturing sector.<br />
<br />
The Association has been clamoring for single-digit lending rates to allow manufacturers access needed funds to boost the performance of the sector.<br />
<br />
This increase, like the previous ones, is evidence that the CBN is either unperturbed about the plight of the productive sector or is unable to fathom out a more creative policy mix that would reflate the sector.<br />
<br />
We are persuaded that monetary authority is oblivious of the fact that the failure of its tightening policy to address the inflationary pressure is because the hike in inflation is largely caused by a combination of familiar challenges, including low output which is attributed to instability of macroeconomic variables, inconsistent and lackluster fiscal policy regime, incoherent industrial policies, challenging and expensive operating environment, exploitative regulation, external shocks and poor exchange rate management.<br />
<br />
Therefore, there is a need to address the identified root causes of inflation and refrain from intensifying policy choices that hamper the performance of the real sectors of the economy.&quot;</p>
