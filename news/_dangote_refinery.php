                    <p class="post">Dangote Petroleum Refinery will services 26,716 filling stations and 129 depots in Nigeria.<br />
<br />
Segun Ajayi-Kadir, the Director-General of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), gives this estimate ahead of the commissioning of the refinery by President Muhammadu Buhari,  next week in Lagos.<br />

The refinery located at Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos, on land spanning approximately 2,635 hectares is said to be the World’s Largest Single Train 650,000 barrels per day Petroleum Refinery with a 9000 KTPA Polypropylene Plant ever built.<br />
<br />
&quot; For all the determination and trail blazing zeal to bring this dream into reality, MAN  Congratulate the President/CEO of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, on the completion and the official commissioning of this pride-of-Africa birthed-in-Nigeria project,&#039;&#039; said Ajayi-Kadir.<br />
<br />
He said that the coming onboard of the Dangote Refinery promises to bring to pleasant end, the nightmare of long queues at petrol filling station and the disruption of social and economic activities that come with it.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
▪︎With State-of-the-art technology, the refinery is designed to produce with 100% Nigerian Crude with the flexibility to process other crudes from Africa, Middle East, and US Light Oil.<br />
