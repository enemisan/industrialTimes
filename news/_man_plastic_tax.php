                    <p class="post">The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN) has called on the Federal Government to reverse the Single Use Plastics tax of 10 percent slammed on companies in the sector as contained in the 2023 Fiscal policy guidelines .<br />
<br />
This is to enable the country to meeting the climate change goals of green environment.<br />
<br />
At a press briefing in Lagos, Wednesday, Otunba Francis Meshioye, President of the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), said that the surcharge of 10 percent on Single Use Plastic under HS Code 3919.10.00.00 and 3919.90.00.00 as well as Headings - 39.20; 39.2, and 39.23 (Plastic Containers, Films and Bags), appears ill-timed and hasty in view of the fact that Government, through the Federal Ministry of Environment, is currently working towards instituting a Plastic Cycle Waste Management Policy with technical assistance from the United Nations Industrial Organisation (UNIDO) along with support from the Japanese government.<br />
<br />
&quot; The project is to institute a long-term solution to manage the menace of plastic wastes and assist the affected industries to retrofit, thereby reaching the threshold of the United Nations goal of green environment as being espoused by the series of the UN organized Conference of Parties (COP).<br />
<br />
&quot; It is therefore necessary that this process should be allowed to reach its conclusive end before other measures such as provisioned in the 2023 Fiscal policy guidelines are pronounced by Government,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
A good example of this is the Food &amp; Beverage Recycling Alliance, approved by the federal government.<br />
<br />
&quot; Our primary concern is that it does not appear to have a<br />
basis in law, as it is not provided for under the Customs, Excise, Tariff, etc (Consolidation) Act (CETA), unlike beverages and tobacco. The tax will also further fuel inflation and weaken consumer purchasing power, without achieving the desired climate change objectives,&quot; he said.</p>
